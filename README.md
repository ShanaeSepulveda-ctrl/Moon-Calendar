# Moon-Calendar
A cosmic, lunar-inspired calendar exploring alternative rhythms of time through real moon phases and reflective practices.
# Lunar Rhythm Calendar 🌙

This project explores an alternative way of experiencing time through lunar cycles rather than strictly the Gregorian calendar.

It is a simple, browser-based calendar built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that displays real astronomical moon phases alongside gentle spiritual reflections and practices. The intention is not prediction or authority, but presence, rhythm, and reflection.

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by:
- Lunar phases and seasonal cycles
- Widely shared moon symbolism and reflective practices
- Indigenous and ancestral ways of relating to time (with respect and without claiming direct lineage)

All spiritual language is offered as optional, invitational guidance.

## Features

- Monthly Gregorian calendar view
- Real moon phase calculations (using SunCalc)
- Clickable days with spiritual themes, practices, and affirmations
- Dark, cosmic-inspired design
- Local, offline-friendly functionality

## Status

This is an early, learning-stage project and is actively evolving.  
Code is intentionally kept simple for accessibility and understanding.

## Tech

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- SunCalc (for moon phase calculations)

## Values

- Gentle guidance over productivity pressure
- Respectful, non-authoritative spiritual language
- Curiosity, learning, and experimentation
- Local-first, simple technology

## Future Ideas

- 13-moon / 28-day cycle overlay
- User journaling and reflections (local storage)
- Seasonal and zodiac layers (optional)
- Accessibility and design refinements
